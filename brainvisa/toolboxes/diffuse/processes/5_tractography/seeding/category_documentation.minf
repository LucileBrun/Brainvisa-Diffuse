    <h1>Seeding strategies : the starting point of the so-called local tractography</h1>
      <h2>What is seeding ?</h2>
    <p>
      Once the diffusion in a voxel has been modeled, the next step toward the estimation of white matter fiber trajectories is to integrate
      the resulting discrete field of displacement. In order to do so one requires several things:
      <ul>
        <li>an interpolation method to estimate displcement at any point from discrete desplacement mesures such as FOD</li>
        <li>an integration method (simple Euler, Runge Kutta 2,4  etc.)</li>
        <li> conditions to stop the tracking </li>
        <li> starting points (the seeds) </li>
      </ul>
      As a parameter, the seeds and so the seeding strategies may have a strong influence on obtained tracks.
      Please note that it is only important for what was called local tractography, the global tractography algorithms are not affected by seeding strategies.
    </p>
    <h2>The different seeding strategies</h2>
    The principle of every seeding strategy is the same. Place seed in the space so that most of the signal based tracts are captured.
    In fact, an efficient seeding strategy can be seen as  an efficient way to sample the space of white matter signal tracts from a sparse number
    of seeds. If we forget about the biological meaning of the tracs, it means we seek to reach the whole streamlines p
    <ul>
      <li><i>whole brain volumic seeding</i>: seeds are placed on the whole white matter (or white + grey matter) volume. They can be place either in a deterministic fashion or in the random one</li>
      <li><i>region of interest volumic seeding</i>: for studies focused on particular regions of the brain, one can try to retrieve fibers going through the region by putting volumic seeds in this region</li>
      <li><i>grey/white matter interface seeding</i>: seeds are placed at the grey/white interface using either a grey/white volumic or surfacic segmentation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pro and cons of the different seeding strategies</h2>



    <h2>Which seeding strategies are available in Diffuse?</h2>
    Diffuse provides the user with the three main main strategies detailled above. Seeds can be placed in a volume (ROI, mask, full brain)
    or on a surface (grey/white mesh, subcorticals structure meshes) either in a deterministic fashion (equal repartition, custom repartition) or randomly (uniform).
    To more details please refer to the documentation of the following processes :
    <ul>
      <li>random volumic seeding: <a href="bvprocess://random_seeds_from_mask"><bvProcessName name="random_seeds_from_mask"/></a><a href="bvshowprocess://random_seeds_from_mask"><img src="../../images/icons/icon_process.png" border="0"/></a></li>
      <li>deterministic volumic seeding: <a href="bvprocess://seeds_from_mask"><bvProcessName name="seeds_from_mask"/></a><a href="bvshowprocess://seeds_from_mask"><img src="../../images/icons/icon_process.png" border="0"/></a></li>
      <li>seeding from grey/white interfaces: <a href="bvprocess://seeds_from_mesh"><bvProcessName name="seeds_from_mesh"/></a><a href="bvshowprocess://seeds_from_mesh"><img src="../../images/icons/icon_process.png" border="0"/></a></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
      <h5>IMPORTANT:</h5> Seeds are points or areas in a given space. To insure that obtained tractography is coherent with diffusion volumes
      seeds must be in the same space that diffusion volume in the end. It means that a transformation between the seeding space and diffusion space must be provided
      or that seeding space must be the diffusion space. In Diffuse, since we rely on Aims library for i/o calculation must be done in aims space.
      As a matter of consequence, we impose the seeds to be in the Aims diffusion voxel space !
