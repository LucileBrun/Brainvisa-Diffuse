    <xhtml name="long"> <p>Build a gradient table object that contains  main information about the acquisition scheme used for the data.
        Futhermore, this process handles bvalues (gradient intensities) rounding and bvectors (gradient directions) reorientation in Aims space so that
        data and gradient directions are coherent.</p>
        <p>bvalues obtained from raw DICOM either represents ideal bvalues programmed into the MRI scanner for acquisition or the real bvalues used in the sequence.
        Thus, in the second case,there might be a slight difference on bvalues that should a priori be identical (e.g. 1990 and 2010 for a 2000-asked bvalue). Some algorithms may not be able to handle
        properly this kind of values and that is why rounding the bvalues is (highly) recommended and set on by default</p>
        <p> The coherence of the bvectors orientation must  have been checked before using <a href="bvshowprocess://CorrectGradientOrientation"><img src="../../images/icons/icon_process.png" border="0"/></a> . In order to avoid non coherent orientations we strongly encourage the user to process diffusion data with the dedicated pipeline:<a href="bvshowprocess://PreprocessingPipeline"><img src="../../images/icons/icon_process.png" border="0"/></a>.
            Computation are performed in the AIMS (image processing library used by Brainvisa) coordinate system. Hidden transformation applyied on loading
            from disk space to AIMS space is retrieved and applyied to the bvectors so that orientations remains consistent in working space.</p>
