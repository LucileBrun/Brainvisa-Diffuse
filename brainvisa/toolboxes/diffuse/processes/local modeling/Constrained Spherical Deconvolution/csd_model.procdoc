      <xhtml name="positivity_threshold">Threshold controlling the amplitude below which the amplitude of spherical function( here f-ODF) is assumed to be equal to zero. If the system was well constrained, positivity_threshold should be equal to zero. However, in order to increase stability of the solving, positivity_threshold is set as a percentage of max_value ie 10%=0.1 for example.

      <xhtml name="spherical_harmonic_order">Max order of the spherical harmonic decomposition. sh_order has to be an even positive integer.
Considering the sh_order as n_max,spherical harmonic decomposition will lead to (n_max+1)(n_max+2)/2 coefficients.
Please note that without any additional constraint this decomposition is not unique.</xhtml>
